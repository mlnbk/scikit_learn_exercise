# Scikit-learn: Creating Machine Learning Models Exercise

Scikit-learn: Creating Machine Learning Models exercise project based on the Complete Machine Learning &amp; Data Science Bootcamp Udemy course's related section.

## Prerequisites

- Conda (Miniconda or Anaconda)

## Environment Setup

To set up the Conda environment for this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository

2. Navigate to the Project Directory

3. Create the Environment: Run the following command to create the Conda environment from the `environment.yml` file:

   ```shell
   conda env create --file environment.yml
   ```

   This command will create a new Conda environment based on the specifications in the `environment.yml` file.

4. Activate the Environment: After the environment is created, activate it using the following command:

   ```shell
   conda activate <environment_name>
   ```

   Replace `<environment_name>` with the name of the created Conda environment.

5. Run Jupyter Notebook: With the environment activated, you can launch Jupyter Notebook to interact with the project. Run the following command:

   ```shell
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   This will start the Jupyter Notebook server, and a new browser window or tab should open automatically.

6. Access the Notebooks: In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the project directory and open the desired notebook file (`*.ipynb` extension) by clicking on it. You can now run, modify, and interact with the notebooks as needed.
